let the ideas run wild.

Hello everyone,
I am here creating my frist page in hopes this will be something I can show
to future employers. I kinda fell in love with coding not to long ago and now
want to make it a career. I love sports mainly baseball, dodger fan, and I 
really enjoy sking and snowboarding.
